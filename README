GIT Repo for the code for the xDRF delimitation and optimization project.

The project loosely executes in 5 phases
1: Determine synchronization operations in a program, and construct a graph of these operations according to control flow
2: Determine the synchronization variables used by synchronization operations
3: Determine critical (nDRF) regions based on 1
4: Determine the enclaveness of each nDRF region by cross-checking preceding and following xDRF paths based on 2 and 3
5: Mark the border of ndRF and xDRF regions in code with marker functions based on 4

Passes included:
Main passes:
SynchPointDelim : Executes 1, 2 and 3
XDRFExtension : Executes 4
MarkXDRFRegions : Executes 5

Auxiliary passes:
ThreadDependence : Determines which values in a program are derived from thread arguments or may contain values derived from thread arguments
MarkRMSRegions : Created nDRF-style marker functions from RMS-style marker functions
PathRMSFunctions : Deprecated

See the install_instructions file for information on how to install and use the passes
